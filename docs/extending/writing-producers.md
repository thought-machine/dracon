## Writing Producers

A producer is a program that parses the output of a tool and converts it into Dracon compatible output that can be used by _enrichers_ and _consumers_.

---

Producers can be written in any language that supports protobufs. We currently have examples in Golang and Python. They are all structured in the same way:

1. Parse program arguments:
   1. `in`: the raw tool results file location
   2. `out`: where to place the Dracon compatible output file location
2. Parse the `in` file into Protobufs (`LaunchToolResponse`)
3. Add metadata to Protobufs (e.g. git/source-code information)
4. Write the protobuf bytes to the `out` file

### Producer API

For convenience, there are helper functions in the `./producers` pkg/module for Golang/Python.

See the godoc for more information.
